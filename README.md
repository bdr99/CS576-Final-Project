This example blog website will be used to demonstrate XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks.

## Prerequisites
In order to run this application, you must first install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

## Usage
To run the application, open two terminals. In one terminal, run `mongod` to start the database server. In the other terminal, change to the project directory. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Then, run `npm start` to start the application. If the application starts successfully, you will see the message `Server is running on port 3000`.
